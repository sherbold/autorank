# This tells pydocmd which pages to generate from which Python modules,
# functions and classes. At the first level is the page name, below that
# is a tree of Python member names (modules, classes, etc.) that should be
# documented. Higher indentation leads to smaller header size.

# MkDocs pages configuration. The `<<` operator is sugar added by pydocmd

# Whether to output headers as markdown or HTML.  Used to workaround
# https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/pydoc-markdown/issues/11.  The default is
# to generate HTML with unique and meaningful id tags, which can't be done with
# markdown.
#
# Note: if using the simple generator mode, this will default to 'markdown'
# instead of 'html'.
